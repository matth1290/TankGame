# TankGame
CS10 Final Project - A pygame game 

This was my first ever python project, coded for the CS10 final project at UC Berkeley.

It is a game coded in python using pygame, and in order to run, it requires multiple image files (also included in the repository) to be downloaded into the same folder as the game code (final_proj.py)

Gameplay:

OBJECTIVE: Earn the highest score possible. Earn points by shooting bombs or avoiding lightning

GAME ENDS IF: Bomb hits floor, or lightning hits tank

control the tank using the left and right arrow keys

shoot projectiles using the spacebar

different bombs are worth different point amounts

game progressively gets faster
